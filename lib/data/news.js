For years, our staff has inquired, researched, and waited patiently for the right opportunity to bring the appropriate Elite Program to our members and to the Santa Clarita Valley. We watched as other clubs in the valley immediately flocked to every up and coming league.  Recently, MLS NEXT announced a new competition tier which will ultimately allow for more clubs access to the elite programming circuits that it governs and overseas.  In collaboration with Los Angeles Soccer Club (LASC), we believe we have found the right partner to help us reach our goal and improve the programs offered by the Club,  bringing one of the Elite Academy programs to Santa Clarita.",

Our remaining teams, both boys and girls, will still be participating in SoCal Soccer League as we explore options and utilize our new affiliation with LASC to bring the right Elite program to our girls teams.",

The leadership at MLS NEXT has created a second tier of play and controls and manages the Elite Academy League, the Elite Academy League 2, as well as having started a “strategic alliance” with the Girls Academy (GA). This consolidation has created a clear pathway for clubs, teams, and players to be able to fulfill the players potential of every level. One of the main deciding factors to join EA-2, instead of other leagues like ECRL-2, was the possibility of moving up the Elite programming competition pyramid into the Elite Academy League (EA), as well as being able to extend the program to our 9v9 age groups teams which other programs don’t have. The possibility of being promoted into a higher level of competition was a very important and focal point of our decision.",
